# Two-sided Market Pricing Strategy

A simulated analysis of two-sided network effect and an optimal pricing strategy algorithm for the two-sided platform.

### File Description

* ne.cpp
	* proves how network effects influence market pricing, user demands and platform profits through mathematical modeling, computer simulation and numerical analysis.  
* dy.cpp
	* expands the one-sided market dynamics theory to two-sided market.  
* dp.cpp
	* a DP algorithm calculating the optimal pricing strategy that maximizes the platform profit.
